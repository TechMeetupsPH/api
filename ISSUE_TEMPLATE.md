What is this! It's an issue template! 

For what?
========

You know! Putting new events up! 

How do I contribute new events?
===
Since we are operating on a lean budget and don't want to create a fullblown site just yet (some people would call it smart not to do so yet), you can file an issue ticket!

I will attend to your new events right away, as much as possible!

So three things and one cool thing I need from you when you want something up:

[] Where is the join link or event page located on the web
[] What is the event titled
[] When is the event happening 

wait... one more *cool* thing - 

[] How do you want the "join us here" phrase be phrased. 

It can be in tagalog if you wish. put a "[]" around the word/group of words that you want to be clickable to your event page

PS If I'm away on vacation there will be a notice like "hey I'm not around, please wait X days for me to check your issue out.
