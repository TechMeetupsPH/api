What is this! It's an issue template! 

For you know! Putting new [events](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/event) up! 

How do I contribute new events?
===

I am operating on a lean budget of zero and I don't want to create a fullblown site just yet to accomodate your requests, you can file an issue ticket to file your requests.

I will attend to your new events right away, as much as possible, as long as I have these three things and one cool thing from you! 

- [ ] 1. Where is the join link or event page located on the web
- [ ] 2. What is the event titled
- [ ] 3. When is the event happening 

and... one more thing... - 

- [ ] 4. How do you want the "join us here" phrase be phrased. 

It can be in tagalog. Just put brackets around the word(s) to indicate the link.

Example: "Ito ang link [please click here]" 

TYCA It's going to be legend... dairy :)
